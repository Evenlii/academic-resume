I am currently an undergraduate majoring in Statistics and Economics at UofT. During my academic journey at UofT, I developed a strong interest in data science. Regarding the area of specialization, I am particularly interested in machine learning and am motivated by solving real-world challenges with the combinations of programming technics and statistical theories. I am excited about exploring how the applications of statistical methods and the utilization of programming software can offer powerful insights into the improvement of the business. 

As an individual who has undergone extensive undergraduate studies in the field of statistics and economics, I am incredibly motivated to further proliferate my understanding of the applications of statistics. Most of the projects I have done in the past were based on survey data to analyze existing social issues and topics related to health science.
